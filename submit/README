Known Behaviour/Issues
=====
Not Part of the spec, so we did not attempt to fix them.

1.  If your attempt to run 2 or more instances of the SimpleStreamer on the same
    local machine, it will throw a "Unable to start native grabber error"
    - This happen because (obviously) because the device likely doesn't have
    multiple webcam devices
